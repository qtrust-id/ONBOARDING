# QTrust Tool Stack — Complete Setup Guide

> **Audience:** All QTrust team members  
> **Purpose:** Every tool used across all QTrust projects — who needs what, why, and how to activate it in Claude Desktop.

---

## Why This Matters

Every team member at QTrust works inside **Claude Desktop** as their primary AI co-pilot. Claude's power multiplies when it is connected to your tools via **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** integrations. With the right tools connected, Claude can:

- Pull your sprint issues from Linear and GitHub without you leaving the conversation
- Schedule sprint ceremonies in Google Calendar, which Fireflies auto-joins and transcribes
- Summarise meeting transcripts from Fireflies and surface blockers from Slack
- Query production errors from Sentry and infrastructure metrics from Datadog
- Read Figma designs and generate code that matches them precisely

**MCP connections are per-user.** Each team member must connect their own tools in Claude Desktop. This document tells you exactly which tools to connect and in what order.

## Setup Order — What to Connect First

Connect tools in this priority order. The first four are universal and should be done on Day 1 by every team member.

### Day 1 — Universal (Everyone)

1. **Claude Desktop** — install, sign in, accept project invitation
2. **Google Drive** — install Drive Desktop, connect workspace folder in Claude
3. **GitHub** — create account, accept org invitation, connect MCP
4. **Slack** — join workspace, join project channels, connect MCP
5. **Google Calendar** — connect MCP, join shared project calendar

### Day 1 — Role-Specific

Connect these on Day 1 based on your role:

| If you are... | Also connect on Day 1 |
|---|---|
| UIX Designer | **Figma** (Editor seat — request from IT Head) |
| Project Manager | **Linear** + **Fireflies** |
| CTO / IT Head | All tools |
| Any Engineer | **Sentry** (connect before first feature goes to staging) |

### Before First Sprint

| Tool | Who | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Fireflies** | Everyone | Before your first project meeting |
| **Linear** | Engineers | Before Sprint 1 planning |
| **Sentry** | Backend, Frontend, Mobile, QA | Before first staging deployment |
| **Datadog** | Backend, DevOps | Before first infrastructure provisioning |

## CTO Morning Brief — Sample Prompts

Once all tools are connected, use these prompts every morning for full project visibility:

```
"Give me a CTO morning brief across all active QTrust projects:
1. Google Calendar: what meetings and ceremonies are scheduled today?
2. Linear: sprint progress (% done) and blocked issues per project
3. GitHub: PRs waiting > 2 days for review
4. Sentry: new production errors since yesterday
5. Datadog: any monitors currently in Alert state
6. Fireflies: key decisions or action items from yesterday's meetings
7. Slack: any escalations or critical messages in #incidents or #[project]-alerts"
```

```
"Which QTrust project is most at risk right now based on:
- Blocked issues in Linear
- Open critical bugs in Sentry
- Failed CI/CD runs in GitHub
- Unresolved monitors in Datadog"
```

## Managing Token Usage & Quota

Some workflows consume far more of your Claude usage budget than others. Knowing which — and working efficiently — keeps the whole team productive within plan limits and avoids hitting the daily quota wall.

### Heaviest workloads

- **Design-to-code from Figma** — reading a full Figma file, and especially pulling **screenshots**, loads very large payloads into context. A single unscoped read can consume tens of thousands of tokens.
- **Large data reads** — pulling an entire dataset, long logs, or a big document in one go.
- **Long agentic loops** — many back-and-forth tool calls in one conversation compound usage.

Teams most affected: **UIX Designer** (design generation), **Frontend** and **Mobile** (design-to-code), and **Image Vision** (large datasets/logs).

### Seat strategy (for admins / IT Head)

- **Mix seat types on Team:** give heavy users (UIX, Frontend) a **Premium** seat (~5× the Standard quota) and keep everyone else on **Standard**. Team supports mixing seat types in one workspace.
- **Enterprise** bills usage at API rates with admin-set spend limits — it removes the daily-quota wall entirely and is worth considering when design-to-code volume is high or variable.
- **Calibrate during the pilot:** see who actually hits limits, then upgrade only those seats rather than over-provisioning everyone.

### Efficiency techniques (everyone)

- **Read specific nodes/frames, not whole files.** In Figma Dev Mode, target a node-id rather than the entire file.
- **Avoid screenshots when metadata or code context is enough** — images are the most token-expensive input.
- **Reuse, don't regenerate.** Once Claude has produced a component, iterate on the code rather than re-reading the design from scratch.
- **Pick the right model.** Use Sonnet/Haiku for routine tasks; reserve Opus for genuinely hard problems.
- **Keep conversations scoped.** Start a fresh conversation per task instead of carrying a huge context across many tasks.
- **Batch hand-offs.** Read a set of related frames or files once, do the work, then move on — rather than re-opening the source repeatedly.

> For very heavy, repetitive automation (e.g., bulk design-to-code), the Claude API (pay-per-token) avoids per-seat daily limits entirely.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| MCP not showing as connected | Sign out and reconnect; check OAuth permissions |
| Claude can't see project files | Verify Google Drive Desktop is synced; re-select workspace folder |
| GitHub MCP returns 403 | Ask IT Head to verify your org role and repo access |
| Linear shows wrong workspace | Disconnect and reconnect; select QTrust workspace specifically |
| Sentry returns no results | Verify you are added to the QTrust Sentry org |
| Datadog MCP fails | API key may have expired; request a new key from IT Head |

For any tool access issues, raise in `#engineering` on Slack or contact the IT Head directly.
